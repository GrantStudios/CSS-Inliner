### What is CSS-Inliner?

CSS-Inliner is a robust and extremely simple to use tool that converts external styles (applied through an external stylesheet or through a `style` tag) to inline styles.

This comes in useful if you ever need to make your HTML pages email-friendly, fast (since `style` tags are not supported in some email clients).

## Instructions for use

It's easy as pie! Just paste your HTML and CSS into the designated sections, copy the result and you're good to go!
